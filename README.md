# Testing the site called "Jira"

This project is about testing various Jira features (login, logout, browse projects, browse issues, edit issue, etc.) with automated tests 
using the Page Object Model (POM).

The second exercise was to practice the Behaviour Driven Development (BDD) with some of the 
tests, so all branches that starts with "BDD" are related to this exercise.
